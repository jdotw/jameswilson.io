Shortly before I left California, I finished composing and recording
the material for what would become my second album: Exit Mesa. This
album uses a combination of electronic instruments, hardware and
software, combined with guitar parts recorded live. Mixed and edited
on many flights between Sydney and San Francisco, and finally finished
once I'd found my feet again in Sydney, “Exit Mesa” was released in
early 2019. The performance name is was released under “Strollfold” is
a combination of the two working titles for the album “Strolling off
the Mesa” and “Fold”, which after being written many times on my to-do
list became increasingly shortened to “Work on Stroll & Fold”, and
eventually “Strollfold” became the name that stuck.

Ableton was the DAW of choice for this project, and the sounds were
primary from an Arturia Matrix Brute, Roland Juno 106, Roland TR8-S
drum machine, Access Virus TI2, and a host of software instruments
from Arturia, Xfer Records (Serum) and Native Instruments.
