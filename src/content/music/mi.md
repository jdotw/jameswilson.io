This album was a gift, and is very dear to me. I wanted to step back from creating busy melodic music and try to create something that was pleasing but not distracting. Something so simple that it could be on in the background and I could appreciate it but not have it take my focus away. Simple is very hard to do!

I am grateful for how the process of creating this album taught me to appreciate subtlety and the balance between what's needed to convey a feeling versus what's there to make a statement.

The UDO Super 6 was the mainstay of this album. I've not explored it in-depth, but for me it does one thing and it does it so beautifully well. Some of the Subharmonicon sounds from Leura also came back in this album. The bass, of course, was a Moog Subsequent 37.
