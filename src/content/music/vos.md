This soundscape was created for NinaLovina's Valley of the Subconscious art exhition opening. I took inspiration from the consistent colour pallette that Nina uses throughout these works, combined with the ethereal dream-like nature the paintings. 

> _Nina's work explores our thoughts, patterns, and the way we move through this life form,
> She invites us to reflect on the parts of life we often overlook... the repetition, the performance, the surface patterns that define our days.
> Beneath that surface, her paintings reveal the truth ...stillness, remembering and return to your truth.
> The Valley of the Subconscious becomes both a visual and emotional journey inward, through dreamlike landscapes that mirror the hidden rhythms shaping our human story._
