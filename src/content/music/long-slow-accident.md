Way back in 2005, over the Christmas and New Year holiday break, I
locked myself with a bunch of guitars, a bass guitar, a laptop and a
drum machine. The result was this album: Long, Slow Accident. Unlike
Exit Mesa, this album is very guitar driven and more alternative rock.
This was before the electronic influences took over. If I remember at
the time I also had a Roland JP8000 keyboard and an Akai MPC2000 but
they just didn't gel with me and I ended up selling them soon after I
made this album.

The main guitar used on most tracks is the one guitar I still have
with me from this time, my 1964 Fender Jazzmaster. Some tracks also
used a 1974 Fender Thinline Deluxe that I had at the time but sold
before moving to the US. The acoustic was a Maton EGB808 Artist. And
that reminds me, I need an acoustic guitar again.
