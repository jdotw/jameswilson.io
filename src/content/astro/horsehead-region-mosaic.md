I've always been fascinated by the Horsehead nebula. And, I know that right next to it is the equally stunning Orion Nebula and the lesser known Burning / Running Man nebula. In 2018, toward the end of my time in California, I decided to try an ambitious project of capturing a multi-panel mosaic of the region that encompasses those three features. I figured that if there's enough ionized gas, dust, etc to form those gorgeous nebula so relatively close then it must be a very active region of space. â€¦ I was not disappointed!

In fact, the image literally took my breath away when I first saw all 16 or so panels normalized and stitched together. I used the Hydrogen-Alpha filter and each panel is a single 30-minute exposure for high contrast. This could turn into a multi-year effort to gather a little more data on this region year by year to further bring out the faint details. I'd like to also capture some Oxygen-III and Sulfur-II filtered light to allow for some false-RGB color rendering of the region!

This image was produced using around 16 x 30-minute exposures of different points near by in space. The telescope was the [William Optics Star-71](https://optcorp.com/products/william-optics-star-71mm-apo-f-4-9-refractor-telescope), connected to the [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/open-box-qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-5-position-filter-wheel-and-igp-with-c-thread) camera and [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) guide camera on top of an [Atlas EQ-6](https://optcorp.com/products/sky-watcher-az-eq6-mount) mount. Programming the capture of the mosaic coordinates was made possible using [Sequence Generator Pro, ](https://mainsequencesoftware.com/products/sgpro)and the image was processed, normalized and stitched together in [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com).
