Thin wispy tendrils of ionized gas and dust, floating through space like a lace veil caught in the wind. The data for this image was captured using an [AT8RC](https://optcorp.com/products/tpo-8-carbon-fiber-f-8-ritchey-cretien-reflecting-ota-telescope) telescope and [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-8-position-cfw-igp-with-c-thread) camera on an [Atlas EQ-G](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) mount helped along by a [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) guide camera. Sequenced using [Sequence Generator Pro](https://mainsequencesoftware.com), guided by [OpenPHD2](https://openphdguiding.org) and processed in [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com). The incredible contrast in this image was afforded by the use of [Astrodon 3nm](https://optcorp.com/search?q=astrodon+3nm) narrow-band filters. The data for this image comprised:

- 7 x 30-minute exposures in Hydrogen-Alpha
- 4 x 30-minute exposures in Oxygen-III
