My journey in astrophotography began with a desire to capture what I couldn't otherwise see in the night sky. The bright nebula targets in our galaxy were my first point of call, and even from humble beginnings using a DSLR, I was hooked! Upgrading to a better telescope and camera allowed me to capture galaxies with incredible detail, and nebula with gloriously wide fields of view. … But one target remained elusive. In the light polluted skies over San Jose, CA, I couldn't capture the contrast needed to see the brown hue of interstellar dust.

In 2018, I returned home to Sydney, Australia and a few months later all my astrophotography equipment arrived. In June of 2019, I constructed my usual cadre of the [AT8RC](https://optcorp.com/products/tpo-8-carbon-fiber-f-8-ritchey-cretien-reflecting-ota-telescope), [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-8-position-cfw-igp-with-c-thread) and [Atlas EQ-G](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) with the [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) — this time though it was in a home made condensation proof setup. Who'd have known humidity was such a pain!

This image was constructed using:

- 58 x 300-second exposures in red
- 56 x 300-second exposures in green
- 55 x 300-second exposures in blue

That's the most amount of data I've captured on a single RGB target!

There'a a high-resolution image and more data available on the [Astrobin page](https://www.astrobin.com/iyiwwq/0/) for this nebula. For more info, see the wikipedia page for [NGC6727/NGC6729](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_6729).
