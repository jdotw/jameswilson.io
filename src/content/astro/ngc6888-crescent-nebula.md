The result of processing this data surprised me in terms of the detail and the way in which the false-color of red and blue narrow-band data creates a compelling rendition of this nebula! Two years elapsed between capturing this data and then processing it in 2018. I remember looking at the individual exposures and was blown away by the contrast of just a single frame.

The ironic beauty of this nebula is that it is created by the light from a star illuminating its own supernova remnants. Some 400,000 years ago the star ejected the now glowing-red regions of energized solar wind as it transitioned down to being a red giant.

NGC6888 is roughly 5,000 light years away from Earth. The data for this image was captured with an [AT8RC](https://optcorp.com/products/tpo-8-carbon-fiber-f-8-ritchey-cretien-reflecting-ota-telescope) telescope and [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-8-position-cfw-igp-with-c-thread) camera using[ Astrodon ](https://optcorp.com/search?q=astrodon+lrgb)[Narrow](https://optcorp.com/search?q=astrodon+3nm)[-Band](https://optcorp.com/search?q=astrodon+lrgb) filters, mounted on an [Atlas EQ-G](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) mount helped by a [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) guide camera. The composition of the data was as follows:

- 12 x 1800-second exposures in Hydrogen-Alpha
- 13 x 1800-second exposures in Oxygen-III
- 4 x 1800-second exposures in Sulfur-II

Data capture was orchestrated by [Sequence Generator Pro](https://mainsequencesoftware.com), guided by [OpenPHD2](https://openphdguiding.org) and later processed in [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com).
