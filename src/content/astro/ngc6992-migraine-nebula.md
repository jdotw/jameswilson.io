This is actually the Western Veil Nebula, but as someone who occasionally gets ocular migraines, I refer to this as the Migraine Nebula. I'm grateful for the fact that I don't get the painful headaches associated with this phenomena, but I do get the intense visual hallucinations that look exact like the electrically charged wisps and tendrils of this gorgeous nebula.

Captured using my [AT8RC](https://optcorp.com/products/tpo-8-carbon-fiber-f-8-ritchey-cretien-reflecting-ota-telescope) telescope and [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-8-position-cfw-igp-with-c-thread) combination on top of an [Atlas EQ-G](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) mount that was guided, gently and lovingly, by a [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) guide camera. This is a false-color image constructed from the incredibly narrow 3nm bands of light in the Hydrogen-Alpha and Oxygen-III spectra thanks to [Astrodon Narrow-Band](https://optcorp.com/search?q=astrodon+3nm) filters. The data capture was orchestrated by [Sequence Generator Pro](https://mainsequencesoftware.com/) in tandem with [OpenPHD2](https://openphdguiding.org/) for guiding. Image processing was done in [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com/).
