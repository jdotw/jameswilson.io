title: IC1305 - Cross-Section of Our Galaxy
---

This glorious mass of an unimaginable amount of stars is a cross-section of our own galaxy. Ponder that for a moment. This is our own neighborhood, and each of these tiny points of light could have worlds of untold beauty — and life! — orbiting them. It reminds me of a trip that I took, alone, to the Arches National Park in Utah. At around 9pm at night I drove back out to the park, walked in the pitch black under a new moon to find a clearing among the Park Avenue rock formation. I never had, and never have since, seen such an incredible sky. Ink black cloth coated in a diamond glitter.

I didn't record the exact composition of this image, but it was created using 160 x 300-second exposures using [Astrodon RGB](https://optcorp.com/search?q=astrodon+lrgb) filters. The telescope was the beautifully compact [WilliamOptics Star-71](https://optcorp.com/products/william-optics-star-71mm-apo-f-4-9-refractor-telescope) (the original 5-element version) and a [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-8-position-cfw-igp-with-c-thread) camera on an [Atlas EQ-G](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) mount. Orchestration of the data acquisition was done with [Sequence Generator Pro](https://mainsequencesoftware.com\), guided by [OpenPHD2](https://openphdguiding.org) and a sneaky little [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) on the QSI683. Processing was done in [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com) and retouched in Photoshop.
