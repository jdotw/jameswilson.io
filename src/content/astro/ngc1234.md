This is NGC5236, a spiral galaxy that is 12.0 million light years away. This image was created using 23 hours of data collected from my patio in San Jose, California in 2016. NGC1234 is known for its clear dust lanes and active star forming regions highlighted by pink and blue tones. Those parts that look like a light fog? â€¦ That's all stars!

Given how small this extremely distant target is, I used the [AT8RC](https://optcorp.com/products/tpo-8-carbon-fiber-f-8-ritchey-cretien-reflecting-ota-telescope) telescope for and the [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-8-position-cfw-igp-with-c-thread) camera on an [Atlas EQ-G](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) mount. Orchestration of the data acquisition was done with [Sequence Generator Pro](https://mainsequencesoftware.com\), guided by [OpenPHD2](https://openphdguiding.org) and the wonderful [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2). Processing was done in [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com)and retouched in Photoshop.
