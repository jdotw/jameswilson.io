Scarcity is a top-of-mind concern in our contemporary human existence. We worry about having enough, being enough, accumulating enough, etc. And yet, we would be imperceptibly small in this image where each dot of light is likely a giant that dwarfs our own sun. The regions of darkness, that either blanket out the otherwise abundant stars or create a ripple through the red luminosity, they're the dust from which stars are formed. This is a tiny smallest slice of an unimaginable large and plentiful universe. Scarcity is a myth!
