This is another cross-section of our own galaxy, much like [IC1305](https://jameswilson.io/ic1305-cross-section-of-our-galaxy/), but this time with a lot more nebulosity. I captured this target knowing that it was just outside the very well known and regularly imaged area known as the Lagoon Nebula. What fascinates me about this image is not just the glowing red nebula but the areas of darkness; the vast expanses where stars either do not exist or are masked out by clouds of dust.

This image was created using the following data:

- 32 x 300-second exposures in red
- 26 x 300-second exposures in blue
- 29 x 300-second exposures in green

This time I used the [AT8RC](https://optcorp.com/products/tpo-8-carbon-fiber-f-8-ritchey-cretien-reflecting-ota-telescope) telescope for a narrow field of view and a [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-8-position-cfw-igp-with-c-thread) camera on an [Atlas EQ-G](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) mount. Orchestration of the data acquisition was done with [Sequence Generator Pro](https://mainsequencesoftware.com\), guided by [OpenPHD2](https://openphdguiding.org) and a sneaky little [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) on the QSI683. Processing was done in [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com)and retouched in Photoshop.
