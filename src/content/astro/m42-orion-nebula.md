The first deep-sky object I imaged when starting off with a (relatively) cheap 8â€³ newtonian telescope and a Canon DSLR. It was seeing this color image that got me completely and utterly hooked on astrophotography. Even in quite polluted skies, you can see the Orion Nebula. It looks like a small fuzzy patch just below / above (depending on hemisphere) of the Orion's Belt constellation.
