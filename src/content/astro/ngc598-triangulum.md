---

We live in a neighbourhood of 3 galaxies. The Milky Way, Andromeda, and Triangulum. What you're seeing here is an image produced from data collected in 2015, but the light itself was 2.7 million years old when it reached the surface of the Kodak sensor in my camera. Imagine thatâ€¦ what wonders did each of these photons pass by through their epic journey to my back yard?!

This image was captured in San Jose, California using my [AT8RC](https://optcorp.com/products/tpo-8-carbon-fiber-f-8-ritchey-cretien-reflecting-ota-telescope) telescope and the [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-with-sti-thread) telescope. It's a wide-band image captured using the [Astrodon RGB](https://optcorp.com/search?q=Astrodon++filter) filters. The mount was an [Atlas EQ-6](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) being helped along by a [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) guide camera. All of which was being driven by [Sequence Generator Pro](https://mainsequencesoftware.com/Products/SGPro) and [OpenPHD2](https://openphdguiding.org).
