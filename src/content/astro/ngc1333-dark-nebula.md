title: NGC1333 - Dark Nebula
---

This region of space is a precarious stroll down a fog-filled, neon-lit alley region of space. This is a dark nebula. What you can't see is as much a feature of what you can see. Other astrophotos show incredible fields of stars, nebula and galaxies. Here great clouds of dust are blotting out the stars.

The image was captured with an [AT8RC](https://optcorp.com/products/tpo-8-carbon-fiber-f-8-ritchey-cretien-reflecting-ota-telescope) telescope, connected to a [QSI683WSG](https://optcorp.com/products/qsi-683wsg-mono-ccd-camera-mechanical-shutter-8-position-cfw-igp-with-c-thread) camera and filter wheel, with a [Lodestar X2](https://optcorp.com/products/sx-lodestar-x2) helping with the guiding of an [Orion Atlas EQ-G](https://optcorp.com/products/orion-atlas-eq-g-computerized-goto-mount) mount. Wideband RGB filtering was provided using [Astrodon RGB](https://optcorp.com/search?q=astrodon+lrgb) filters. The data set was as follows:

- 25 x 10-minute exposures in Red
- 18 x 10-minute exposures in Green
- 27 x 10-minute exposures in Blue

Captured using [Sequence Generator Pro](https://mainsequencesoftware.com) and [OpenPHD2](https://openphdguiding.org), and processed using [PixInsight](https://pixinsight.com).
