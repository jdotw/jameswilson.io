        <h1>Who I Am</h1>
        <p>
          I'm an executive leader with 20 years of experience in Software and
          Network Engineering spanning Australia and the US. As Chief Engineer
          at x15ventures in Sydney, I built the engineering team that builds and
          scales the ventures. Promoted to Distinguished Engineer, Retail
          Banking Services, I defined the group Cloud Native and API Strategy to
          drive the transformation toward a micro services cloud architecture
          for CBA Group. At Apple, in Cupertino, I was responsible for the
          engineering teams that developed the Mail, Contacts, Calendar,
          Reminders and Settings apps, the out-of-box device setup experience,
          and the iCloud Data Protection frameworks. I spent time at Amazon Web
          Services in Seattle and Ireland working on applying machine learning
          to network monitoring and anomaly detection at a massive, global
          scale. Outside of work I'm a father, an astrophotographer, musician
          and maker.

          I lead teams to solve complex problems and achieve impactful outcomes
          by being an integrated part of the problem solving process and the
          development of talent within teams. I pride myself on staying active
          as a coder and technical contributor either on the job or through side
          projects to keep my skills sharp and knowledge relevant. When leading
          engineers in an executive capacity, my role is to bridge between what
          the business wants and what the engineering team can deliver. Crucial
          to building trust and confidence within the team is being able to talk
          their language, understand the complexities in their work, and to
          enjoy the pursuit of excellence through software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a driver by nature and have learned how to modulate my management
          approach to suit the individuals that I’m working with and their own
          style, capabilities, and confidence level. I don’t have a prescribed
          management style, but instead strive to build learning organizations
          through leveraging a shared self, organizational and situational
          awareness. Each team is different, every person an individual, and
          each challenge we face will require a different approach. The most
          creative and innovative solutions require us to leverage experience
          and embrace ambiguity.

          <h1>Technical Leadership</h1>
          <p>
            I help organizations make technology choices that are aligned with
            their vision and realize growth potential. I’ve learnt to develop
            frameworks for decision making practices that empower individuals
            and teams to arrive at sound technology choices through
            accountability and autonomy. I can lead an organization through the
            key milestones of their growth from delivering an minimum viable
            product, to readying that product for broad market penetration, to
            scaling up the workforce and infrastructure to support growth, and
            the continued evolution and reinvention of a product or service. I’m
            experienced in enacting architectural shifts to divest non-core
            activities and increase efficiencies, and I’ve worked extensively
            with teams to plot a course through transforming and modernizing
            their front-end, native app and back-end code bases and
            infrastructure.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>People Management</h1><p>
            I can increase the delivery capabilities of an engineering
            organization through hiring, talent development, organizational
            restructuring and performance management. Building trust between
            managers and reports, establishing open dialogs for feedback, and
            instilling a culture of sincere appreciation and recognition enables
            a company to emerge stronger from any challenge. I believe strongly
            in the practice of situational leadership with appreciation for the
            different social styles present in a workforce. I am able to
            modulate the level of directive vs. supportive input I provide to
            match the capabilities vs confidence of a team or an individual.
            I’ve created, restructured and grown teams in the US, EMEA and APAC
            markets and am sensitive to the cultural strengths and opportunities
            to build diversity in thought through global expansion.

        <div>
          <h1>Problem Solving</h1><p>
            I can be hands-on when a team needs deep technical guidance, or
            hands-off when a team can arrive at the solution but needs
            organizational help realizing that outcome. I remain an active
            software developer and code regularly in Swift, Objective-C,
            JavaScript with NodeJS or React, and C. Keeping my coding skills
            sharp allows me to dive deep into solving an architectural problem
            at a whiteboard, or a code-level problem with an engineer. Paramount
            to my ability to be successful in any role is being the bridge
            between the technical language and concepts of an engineering
            organization, and the many other functions within the organization.
            I achieve this through articulating concepts and outcomes in a way
            that resonates with my audience by first understanding their
            concerns, motivating factors and mental model of the problem or
            situation.
